    "The basic reasoning is that the conditional posterior $E[\\beta | Y, \\hat{\\Sigma},  \\hat{\\tau}]$ given variance parameters can approximate the posterior mean for $E[\\beta | Y]$ when $P_2$ is large enough [Kass and Steffey 1989] (whether $P_2$ is large enough can be determined by deriving $E[X\\beta| \\hat{\\Sigma}, \\hat{\\tau}, Y]$ and comparing to the posterior mean estimates). Then, so long as the posterior means $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}$ are stable enough across cross-validation folds, they can be used as plug-in estimates in the conditional mean in $E[X\\beta | Y_{-j}, \\hat{\\Sigma}, \\hat{\\tau}]$ to produce approximations of   $E[X\\beta | Y_{-j}]$. \n",

    "By conditioning on the variance-covariance parameters, we shift the CV problem from probability-based sampling to the same form as maximum likelihood methods for simple linear regression} and is likewise $O\\left(N^2P + P^3 \\right)$ in time for each CV fold. It can be used with any CV schema, e.g. K-fold, leave-one-out (LOO), and leave-one-cluster-out (LCO). Our paper focuses on LCO-CV.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation (LCO-CV)\n",
    " LCO-CV is commonly used in models with complex dependency structures, such as spatio-temporal models or models with repeated measures.  In such models, the dependency among the data can cause $K$-fold CV to select models which overfit [@arlot2010survey, @opsomer2001nonparametric]. Reducing the amount of correlation between the training and test data typically results in non-random, structured CV, of which LCO-CV is one commoon example. Under LCO-CV, the data are partitioned based on the unique values of one or more random intercepts, e.g. for a mixed-effects model with repeated measures, all repeated measures for a test unit are set aside from the training data. This provides a more realistic estimate of a model's predictive capability for a new unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we have found that AXE improves upon existing LCO-CV methods in accuracy and is typically an order of magnitude faster. \n",

    "## Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, we use expectation propagation with a Gaussian approximating density, the first-stage of the hierarchical model is approximated with a normal distribution with matching moments. This allows us to use the same equations as the LMM case, just with the transformed response and variance parameters. \n",
